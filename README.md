## Build

### Prerequisits:
- MacOS Sonoma or later
- Xcode 15 or later
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

```sh
brew install cocoapods bartycrouch fastlane rustup-init automake autoconf libtool gettext cmake
rustup-init -y
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim x86_64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo install cbindgen
git clone git@github.com:guardianproject/orbot-apple.git
cd orbot-apple
git submodule update --init --recursive
pod update
leaf-ffi-orbot/build-leaf.sh
open Orbot.xcworkspace
```

Configure your code signing credentials in [`Config.xcconfig`](Shared/Config.xcconfig)!

You will need to manually create App IDs, a group ID, and profiles.

[Network Extensions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension)
can only run on real devices, not in the simulator.


## Localization

Localization is done with [BartyCrouch](https://github.com/Flinesoft/BartyCrouch),
licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/Flinesoft/BartyCrouch/blob/main/LICENSE).

Just add new `NSLocalizedStrings` calls to the code. After a build, they will 
automatically show up in [`Localizable.strings`](Shared/en.lproj/Localizable.strings).

Don't use storyboard and xib file localization. That just messes up everything.
Localize these by explicit calls in the code.


## IPC / Use with Other Apps

Orbot registers to handle the scheme `orbot` and associates the domain https://orbot.app.

Using the associated domain is preferred, as it protects against other apps trying 
to hijack the `orbot` scheme and it provides a nice fallback for users who don't 
have Orbot installed, yet.

The following URIs are available to interact with Orbot from other apps:

- `https://orbot.app/rc/show` OR `orbot:show` 
  Will just start the Orbot app.
  
- `https://orbot.app/rc/start` OR `orbot:start`
  Will start the Network Extension, if not already started. 
  (NOTE: There's no "stop" for security reasons!)

- `https://orbot.app/rc/show/settings` OR `orbot:show/settings`
  Will show the `SettingsViewController`, where users can edit their Tor configuration.

- `https://orbot.app/rc/show/bridges` OR `orbot:show/bridges`
  Will show the `BridgeConfViewController`, where users can change their bridge configuration.

- `https://orbot.app/rc/show/auth` OR `orbot:show/auth`
  Will show the `AuthViewController`, where users can edit their v3 onion service authentication tokens.

- `https://orbot.app/rc/add/auth?url=http%3A%2F%2Fexample23472834zasd.onion&key=12345678examplekey12345678`
  OR `orbot:add/auth?url=http%3A%2F%2Fexample23472834zasd.onion&key=12345678examplekey12345678`
  Will show the `AuthViewController`, which will display a prefilled "Add" dialog.
  The user can then add that auth key.
  You don't need to provide all pieces. E.g. for the URL the second-level domain would be enough.
  Orbot will do its best to sanitize the arguments.
  
You can call these URIs like this:

```swift
	UIApplication.shared.open(URL(string: "https://orbot.app/rc/start")!)
```

### How to use experimental Onionmasq/Arti
- Change the reference to Tor in the Podfile to `Tor/Onionmasq` and use the `:git` master or download 
  into another directory and reference that. Run `pod update` after that.
- Change the key `NSExtensionPrincipalClass` from `$(PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME).LeafPTProvider` 
  to `$(PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME).OnionmasqPTProvider` in `TorVPN/Info.plist` and/or `TorVPN Mac/Info.plist`.
- Configure your code signing credentials in [`Config.xcconfig`](Shared/Config.xcconfig).

=> You should be good to go. 

Look out for `USE_ONIONMASQ` references in the code: there you'll find the 
special handling necessary for Onionmasq.

NOTE: No bridge support, yet! iOS 50 MB memory limit might crash Onionmasq. 
There's no limit on macOS.
